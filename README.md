How to install Ruby on Rails for Ruby version 1.8.7

Doing Try and Error....

````
$ gem install i18n -v 0.6.11
$ gem install rake -v 10.5.0
$ gem install rack -v 1.6.4
$ gem install rack-cache -v 1.2

$ gem install rails -v 3.2.22.5
````

I've once failed to create new rails project because of SSL feature had not included in Ruby 1.8.7 itself, so I followed the instruction described here(https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/issues/197), then solved the problem.
